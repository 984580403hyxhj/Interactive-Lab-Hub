## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Setting: This interaction happens on the phone, ideally at home(it plays music) 

Players: Owner of the phone;  anyone who wants an expression of his current mood/feelings through a visual and auditory output.

Activity: The player tells an emotion they are feeling to the website, and it displays a color  and plays music corresponding to the mood. 

Goals: the website will play the music and display the color that resonates with the user’s mood/emotion, to amplify the user’s current emotion.


\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*
Storyboards: https://github.com/984580403hyxhj/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Lab1_2.pdf


\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
Music and color does create an atmosphere better than we planned.
The interaction is very simple, it is easier to understand than what we expected.


\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
We can create a mapping with the color and the music, so there would be less delay between the color and the music.
We can also make the color dynamic, make it feel breathing.
We need to filter the music played in our interface(bad words, ethnicity, and etc), to improve the the user experience


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
I think it would be very cool if we can search video, and display it on our screen

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Prototype: https://github.com/984580403hyxhj/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/IMG_3523.mov




\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
We came up with a mapping of colors and emotions, and also found music. Our prototype is on our phone, but if we can move this interaction to other platform we can improve the effect. We decided to use a TV with speakers.
List:
Happy: happy background music ; orange
Sad: pathetique; blue
Scared: sad horror music; black
Social: Buena Vista Social Club; pink
Exciting: Mood; yellow
Angry: req45, Red
Chill: bach, Green


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
In nature, we want to use this device to amplify the user’s emotion, and designing it to look a certain way will definitely help to amplify certain emotions. We are concerned that it will reduce the experience of other emotions(having a cute animal design probably doesn’t go with sadness).
Neutral: It is similar to Amazon Alexa, it is a little intrusive, making the user aware of the existence of the device.
Animal: it is supposed to look like a cute animal, the most intrusive design
Lamp: it is the least intrusive design, so that the user won’t even notice the existence of it.


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 
Team members: Jingze Xue, Uddandam Akhil, Toby, and Christy


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
